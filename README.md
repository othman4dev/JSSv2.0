JSS, short for JavaScript Styles, is a powerful framework that introduces its own syntax known as JSS, a blend of JavaScript and CSS.

# Get Started

Clone the framework repository using:

```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/othman4dev/JSSv2.0.git
```

Navigate to the framework directory, where you will find a file called style.jss. This is your JSS file where you can write code following our syntax.
<br>
<i>You can learn JSS at [our Website for documentation](https://jssdev.tech)</i>

After writing your JSS code, itâ€™s time to transpile it to JavaScript and/or CSS.

#### First, install the necessary packages: :

```bash
    npm install
```


#### To transpile to both JavaScript and CSS:

```bash
    npm run jss
```
This command generates two files:
- <b>jss.js :</b> Contains the JavaScript code for features that cannot be achieved with CSS alone.
- <b>css.js :</b> Contains simple styles that do not require JavaScript.

Link these files to your document to see the results.

### Additional Commands
To explore more commands for customizing your output, run:

```bash
    npm run jss:help
```


### Now Let's Explore The Key Differences Between JSS and CSS.

### In CSS
```css
#div {
    background-color: #fff;
    color: white;
    z-index: 1;
}
```

### In JSS
```css
#div {
    backgroundColor = #fff;
    color = white;
    zIndex = 1;
}
```

In JSS, CSS style properties are replaced with JavaScript-style properties, using the = operator for assignment instead of :.     

We bring numerous features tailored to aid in DOM manipulation, leveraging JavaScript's prowess in this domain.

## New JavaScript propreties

We allow use of numerous new propreties like

```css
    form {
        innerHTML = `<input type="text" name="email" />`;
    }
    .checkout-btn:click {
        textContent = `Verifying`;
    }
    #textaria {
        innerText = `Write description here`;
    }
    .btn:hover {
        outerHTML = `<button id='unallow'>unallowed</button>`;
    }
```

Properties like innerHTML, innerText, outerHTML, and textContent can be used directly within your CSS.

## Reference Properties

Elements can clone any other element's property value:

```css
#div1 {
    backgroundColor = (#div2)->backgroundColor;
    height = (#div3)->width;
}
```

In this example, #div1 adopts #div2's backgroundColor and #div3's width as its own height.

## Indexing

You can add an index to any multiple selector like classes and tags:

```css
/*Select the first element*/
.dropdown[0] {
    display = flex;
    opacity = 1;
}
/*Select the third element*/
.dropdown[2] {
    display = none;
    opacity = 0;
}
```

As in most programming languages, indexing starts at 0.

## Events

JSS introduces event handling directly within the syntax:

```css
.header:click {
    backgroundColor = green;
    fontFamily = 'Arial';
}

.notification:mouseover {
    opacity = 1;
}

.notification:mouseout {
    opacity = 0.5;
}
```

This allows you to write event-based styles without relying on JavaScript functions.

## Conditionals

JSS supports conditionals for both DOM manipulation and logical operations:

```css
if ((#div)->width >= 100px ) {
    .modal {
        display = none;
    }
}
```

## Functions

JSS functions enable complex DOM modifications triggered by events or conditions:
```css
function event((#div):click) {
    #div15 {
        display = flex;
        borderRadius = 50px;
    }
}
function delay(5s) {
    .ads[0] {
        display = block;
    }
}
```

This feature eliminates the need for JavaScript functions to handle modals or animations.
Delay functions allow you to set time related operations from JSS.

## Combining Functions with Conditionals

A complete example of a JSS function with event-based conditional actions:

```css
function event((#btn):click) {
    if ((#modal)->display = block) {
        #modal {
            display = none;
        }
    } else {
        #modal {
            display = flex;
        }
    }
}
```

## Event Handling Functionality

We are developing functionality for streamlined addition of complex event handlers:

```css
function event((#id6):click) {
    #id7 {
        backgroundColor = white;
        transition = 1s;
    }
    #id6 {
        backgroundColor = red;
    }
}
```

## Variables and Variables Blocks.

Assign variables and variable blocks easily with JSS:

```css
    --primaryColor = #0091dc;
    --toCenterFlex = {
        display = flex;
        alignItems = center;
        justifyContent = center;
    }
    --initialBG = (#modal1)->backgroundColor;
    header {
        --toCenterFlex;
        backgroundColor = --primaryColor;
    }
```

Re-assigning a value to an existing variable will overwrite it.

## Calculations

Calculations are simplified, allowing you to compute style values of elements:

```css
    .side-bar {
        width = (.main)->width / 3;
        height = 100vh - 60px;
    }
```

If the unit is undefined, the framework returns the first value without applying any calculations.

## The "Tunnel" Feature

The "Tunnel" feature allows elements to share or proportionally relate values:

```css
#div2:::#div1 {
    /* The width will remain the same */
    width(1);
    /* The height will be increased by 150% */
    height(1.5);
}
```

The "Tunnel" feature ensures synchronized properties across elements. Although memory-intensive, we are actively optimizing it for better performance.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of JSS, empowering you with a blend of JavaScript flexibility and CSS simplicity. Explore the possibilities, and let JSS revolutionize your styling experience!

### [NOTE ! :]() This framework is under continous development for the moment and it is not very suitable for production.

Contact me if you care to collaborate on this project.

We still have to build:
- A website with a good documentation of this framework using this framework.
- A Visual Code Studio extention and plugins (language support, syntax highlighter, autocomplete).
